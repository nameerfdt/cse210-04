# Greed Overview
Greed is a game in which the player, a miner, seeks to gather as many falling gems as possible.
As the miner moves side to side and mines a gem, a point is earned. If a boulder is mined, the 
player loses a point. Gems and boulders are removed when either touched or untouched. The game
ends when the miner closes the mine, aka the game window.
